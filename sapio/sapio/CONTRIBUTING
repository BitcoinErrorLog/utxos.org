To the fullest extent of the law possible in any and all jurisdictions, contributor agrees to
transfer all intellectualy property rights (including copyright or patent) to Judica, Inc for code
or patches submitted to this project.


This is a temporary measure, and the code will eventually be released under an open source licensing
scheme, but the above (aggressive) Contributor License Agreement is in place to permit flexibility
in choosing a licensing scheme down the line.
