# Sapio Contrib

Sapio Contrib functions as a definitely-not-a-stdlib for Sapio.

Here you'll find interesting contracts or functions that are not core Sapio
functionality, but may be useful to others. Over time, functionality that is
depended on widely may become standardized into a separate crate.
