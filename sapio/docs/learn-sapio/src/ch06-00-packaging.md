# Application Packaging

So you've written a Sapio contract and you're ready to get it out into the
world.

How should you release it? How should you use it?

This section covers various ways to deploy and use Sapio contracts.

In general, it is important to make the code available in an open source way,
so others can integrate and use your contracts. Rust's [crates](crates.io)
system provides a natural place to publish for the time being, although
in the future we may build a Sapio specific package manager as smart contracts
have some unique differences.
