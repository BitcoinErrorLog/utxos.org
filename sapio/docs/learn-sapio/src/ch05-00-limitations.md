# Limitations of Sapio

Sapio is rapidly maturing, but it is still early-days for bitcoin smart
contract compilers, and early-days for Sapio in particular. As such, one
should be careful to closely audit smart contracts designed with Sapio, be
careful to only use such contracts with trusted inputs, and in general take
precautions to ensure security of funds. As Sapio matures and we gain
confidence in smart contracts built with it, Sapio should be able to greatly
improve the security for many bitcoin users and applications.

Other than these general "alpha software" disclaimers, Sapio is designed with
certain upgrades to Bitcoin in mind that have not yet landed. While Sapio is
designed to work even without these upgrades, the functionality is severely
reduced or has a different security model.

This section goes over some of these limitations and when we might expect to
see them addressed.
